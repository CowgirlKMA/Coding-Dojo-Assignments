Hello! I'm Katie and I am a recent graduate of Coding Dojo's software development bootcamp. I have no prior experience with coding. The first two weeks of the course were focused on Programming Basics. The next four weeks covered Web Fundamentals. The following eight weeks I learned Python (full stack) and in conclusion another four weeks was spent on Algorithms and Projects. This Coding Portfolio follows that journey of learning.
